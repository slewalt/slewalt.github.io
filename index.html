		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I am currently a studio & store manager for a jewelry designer with a 3D installation artist back ground, living in Seattle, WA.  Oh, and I make & design custom pinatas.  I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to understand how to format & design websites.  I’ve taken a stab at customizing websites built on an already existing template, but mainly through googling a series of questions until something reacts the way I want it to.  I want to understand the structure & function of websites & how I can combine that with design.</p>

		<h2>My Mission</h2>
			<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a self supported artist and free-lance web designer working with other artists or entrepreneurs that need help with branding & a place to showcase their work.  I like to work in an environment that is just beginning & communicating the vision to the world through design.</p>
