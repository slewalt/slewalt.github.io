		<h1>Unit 2 HW: Sara Ewalt</h1>
		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
			<p>I'm inspired by <a href="http://seachant.co">
			seachant.co</a> that I found through <a href="http://siteinspire.com">siteinspire.com</a> and <a href="http://humcreative.com">humcreative.com</a> who are friends of mine, and a great design team here in Seattle.</p>
		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
			<p>Seachant.co uses a bold large image to engage you at the beginning, and then smaller thumbnail images in 3 columns to show the body of work, each image then has a page attached to it that defines more what the specific project is about.  The main page though is all about the inital images and shows the body of work as a whole, representing their style.  The white background and simple black text work together to keep your focus on the work.</p>
			<p>Humcreative.com is a more alternative style of website, breaking out of the grid system on the main page.  It is cohesive through color and repetative rows defined by color blocks.  The simple copy and bold images work together to define what they're style and brand are all about.</p>
		<h2>What makes them similar and different</h2>
			<p>Both sites draw you in with a strong focal point when you get to the site, seachant.co with a large-scale photo and their logo, and humcreative.com with a simple, but whitty slogan.  They both have elements that are interactive when your mouse hits them, making you want to investigate more buttons on the site.  They both make you want to access more of the content.  Humcreative.com gives you a sneak peak of a photo book they did, but to access the full image, you need to scroll to see it, then that's followed by another great piece, and so on.  Seachant.co uses thumbnails to give you a larger picture of their collective body of work, but I like how the navigation tools stay at the top of the page for easy access.  Humcreative.com uses repetative rows to define content, and pops of the same colors throughout, even in photos to keep the site feeling cohesive.  Seachant.co is cohesive through the editing of the photos on the site, they are slightly muted in tones and evoke the same quiet repetitiveness that the sea has.</p>
		<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Home Page</strong><br><img src="http://slewalt.github.io/Unit2/HomePage.jpg">
					<p>This homepage starts with a scrolling set of images that would define a larger body of work. The logo would be centered and it would have simple menu buttons on the top and bottom of the image for navigation.</p></li>
				<li><strong>Project Pages</strong><br><img src="http://slewalt.github.io/Unit2/ProjectPage.jpg">
					<p>The project pages would also be clean and simple, focusing mainly on images and each with a description.  Navigation buttons would be in the same place on each page.</p></li>
